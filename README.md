## Features

- Works across the entire [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) stack
  - App Router
  - Pages Router
  - Middleware
  - Client
  - Server
  - It just works!
- supabase-ssr. A package to configure Supabase Auth to use cookies
- Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Components with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Optional deployment with [Supabase Vercel Integration and Vercel deploy](#deploy-your-own)
  - Environment variables automatically assigned to Vercel project

## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Supabase GitHub org](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/new/choose).

# Snake.io Game

A multiplayer snake game inspired by Slither.io, built with Next.js, HTML5 Canvas, and WebSockets.

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay
- Smooth snake movement using mouse controls
- Eat pellets to grow larger
- Collision detection with other snakes
- Leaderboard to track top players
- Works in both online and offline modes
- Responsive design that works on various devices

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Server**: Node.js, Express
- **Authentication**: Supabase (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snake-io-game
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Game

#### Development Mode

Run both the Next.js app and the game server concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run the Next.js app
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run the game server
npm run dev:server
```

#### Production Mode

Build and start the application:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Start the game server:

```bash
npm run server
```

### Game Controls

- **Mouse Movement**: Control the direction of your snake
- **Click**: Restart the game after death

## Architecture

This project follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Client-side (Next.js)**:
   - Renders the game using HTML5 Canvas
   - Handles user input and displays game state
   - Communicates with the server via WebSockets

2. **Server-side (Node.js)**:
   - Manages the game state and logic
   - Processes player movements and collisions
   - Broadcasts updates to all connected clients

The game is designed to work both in online multiplayer mode and offline single-player mode for development and testing.
